# CodingGeneralLearningTesting
A repository for all testing, learning and stuff for coding. Or random small projects that I did.

## Why was this project made?
If I make small code things I'll put it in here. This is for small tools and learning stuff.
See a list of projects below. They're hopefully not too bad.
